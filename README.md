# Alu-by-verliog-and-testbench
Introduction: - ALU is the fundamental building block of the processor, which is responsible for carrying out the arithmetic, logic functions, Shift functions and Comparison functions. Specification: ● ALU Operands (A, B) ● ALU Result (ALU_OUT) ● ALU operands and output Result are of 16-bit width. ● ALU Result (ALU_OUT) is registered. ● The ALU function is carried out according to the value of the ALU_FUN input signal stated in the table in the following page and any other value for ALU_FUN not stated in the table, ALU_OUT must equal to 16’b0 ● Arith_flag is activated "High" only when ALU performs one of the arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, division), otherwise "LOW" ● Logic_flag is activated "High" only when ALU performs one of the Boolean operations (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR), otherwise "LOW" ● CMP_flag is activated "High" only when ALU performs one of the Comparison operations (Equal, Greater than, less than), otherwise "LOW" ● Shift_flag is activated "High" only when ALU performs one of the shifting operations (shift right, shift left), otherwise "LOW"
